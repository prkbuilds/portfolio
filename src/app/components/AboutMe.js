          I am a skilled Software Developer with experience in designing and
          analyzing web applications. I specialize in front-end and back-end
          development using the MERN stack, Material-UI, REST APIs, and MVC
          architecture. My expertise extends to scaling cloud applications with
          GCP and AWS, and I have a strong interest in cryptography and computer
          security.
